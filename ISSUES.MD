Schema Ordering Performance Concern (ExcelSheet.EnsureOrder.cs:100-121)

Status: Addressed
- Change: Preserve fast-path and switch to single-batch reordering.
- Details: Build an ordered buffer and call `worksheet.Append(orderedArray)` once instead of per-item `AppendChild`. Unknown element types are appended after known schema-ordered types while preserving original order. This avoids O(n¬≤)-like overhead from repeated DOM appends.
- File: `OfficeIMO.Excel/ExcelSheet.EnsureOrder.cs`
- Result: O(n) reordering with noticeably lower overhead for large worksheets (>100 elements and beyond).

Potential Resource Management Issue (ExcelSheet.ExecutionHelper.cs:51-56)

Status: Reviewed ‚Äî no change
- The defensive lock retrieval with try/catch and null-tolerance is appropriate. Left intact.
- File: `OfficeIMO.Excel/ExcelSheet.ExecutionHelper.cs`

Low Priority
Inconsistent Parameter Naming

Status: Addressed
- Change: Standardized parameter names in `ExecutionPolicy.Decide(string operationName, int itemCount)` and expanded XML docs.
- Callers already pass descriptive names; signature unchanged beyond identifiers/docs.
- File: `OfficeIMO.Excel/ExecutionPolicy.cs`
Missing XML Documentation

Status: Addressed
- Change: Added XML docs and remarks to `ExecuteWithPolicy` describing the compute/apply contract, locking rules, and guidance.
- File: `OfficeIMO.Excel/ExcelSheet.ExecutionHelper.cs`
üîç Security Assessment

No security-relevant risks identified in the changed areas. The changes operate on in-memory OpenXML DOM objects and maintain existing locking semantics for write operations.
