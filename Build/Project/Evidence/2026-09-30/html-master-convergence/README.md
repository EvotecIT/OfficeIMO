# HTML shared-owner convergence and comparison evidence

This run qualifies source `40bd3f7bbbf0aff338336511ed899d27f79cd3fe` after integrating master `344dd83dc12e48d98fba933194f7773f84be212d`. The [compact record](qualification.json) binds test results, package inspection, reference versions, archive identity, output hashes and operation costs. The references are package/source pins, not a claim that every runtime dependency has been upgraded to its latest release. Open delivery work belongs in [the product roadmap](../../../../../Docs/ROADMAP.md#independent-html-engine).

## Integration result

The engine uses the current owned VP8 decoder and MIT Core package metadata. The obsolete prediction scratch implementation and CodeGlyphX license copy are removed; libvpx license and patent notices remain. Drawing uses the shared inspected caller-codec boundary once. PDF logical-cluster isolation preserves authored font tracking and its following text origin. Both system-font loaders prefer the exact family while retaining localized full/PostScript aliases. The runtime worker uses the current responsive-image selection contract, and its depth-limit test follows the shared error-as-failure contract.

An independent read-only review found two font-selection defects. Both reproduced in bounded fixtures, were fixed, and received one targeted confirmation. Full HTML tests pass 3,935/3,935, PDF 8,600/8,600 and Drawing 2,828/2,828 on .NET 8 and .NET 10. Runtime passes 646/646 on .NET 10. The HTML-to-PDF netstandard2.0 graph builds without warnings. Existing PDF test-source warnings remain outside this change.

H4 advanced held-out acceptance passes 8/8. Its unchanged macOS static budgets pass. All ten planetary PDF/editable operations pass their unchanged macOS ceilings; every operation still reports loss. This does not qualify Windows/Linux H10 costs or editable appearance.

## Frozen-page result

The planetary archive retains SHA-256 `305c6522e6c84a70ec1b9399725a1e7ed320762866abbcde99ff434f692e5ae2`. All eleven OfficeIMO PDF variants complete and preserve their previous page counts, extracted text-token multisets and image counts. Poppler extraction counts 3,292 word tokens per variant; that tokenizer is separate from earlier OfficeIMO extraction counts. Zero-margin print remains 16 pages with 18 color-image occurrences and six soft masks, or 24 image objects including masks.

PDF bytes change across integration. At 72 dpi, eight zero-margin pages are pixel-identical to the preceding checkpoint; eight have text-spacing/wrapping differences. Pages 9, 12 and 16 were inspected alongside the previous output. The table remains on OfficeIMO page 10 versus frozen Chromium page 9, and heading/footer differences remain open. The changed pixels are recorded, not accepted as browser equivalence.

PeachPDF **0.9.20**, isolated in the opt-in comparison project, now converts this archive successfully to 14 pages. The earlier 0.9.19 bookmark-geometry failure is historical and must not describe the current comparator. Fourteen pages do not establish better fidelity: resource, content and geometry criteria still need independent acceptance. The same input has distinct print, screen-media and snapshot contracts; PeachPDF's print lane does not measure OfficeIMO's other intents or editable exports.

## Capability assessment at the published reference boundary

The comparison uses the published [v0.9.20 HTML/CSS](https://github.com/jhaygood86/PeachPDF/blob/v0.9.20/docs/html-css-support.md), [SVG](https://github.com/jhaygood86/PeachPDF/blob/v0.9.20/docs/supported-svg-features.md) and [MathML](https://github.com/jhaygood86/PeachPDF/blob/v0.9.20/docs/supported-mathml-features.md) contracts. Their hashes are retained in the record. A documented reference capability is not a paired-fixture pass.

| Area | OfficeIMO evidence | Comparison conclusion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unfamiliar-page flow, responsive sizing and captured resources | Named WAI, MDN, NASA, NIST, NOAA, Yellowstone, EPA and FWS limits remain in the roadmap; H4 qualifies a selected corpus | Highest-priority outcome gap. Qualify appearance, content, links and losses across frozen pages rather than treating equal page counts as acceptance. |
| Default raster decode | Owned opaque VP8 and VP8L; separately encoded ALPH/animated WebP uses a bounded caller codec. The managed decode graph has no AVIF path | Source-confirmed default capability gaps against v0.9.20's alpha-WebP and baseline still-image AVIF contract. Add independent fixtures before implementing; keep codec policy in Core. |
| Page and column floats | Float normalization accepts left/right, logical sides and footnote; top/bottom/snap/inside/outside are diagnosed fallbacks. No column-scoped float-reference layout path | Source-confirmed scope gap against the reference's page/column float contract. Existing page footnotes must not be counted as absent. |
| Automatic language hyphenation | Manual soft hyphens, limits and host-supplied callback/dictionary work. No shipped language-pattern catalog | Default-provider gap against shipped pattern-based languages. Qualify language fallback, dictionary provenance and mixed-language input through the shared text owner. |
| SVG paint and resource coverage | Native geometry, text, selected gradients/clips/masks/effects already exist; the support matrix identifies bounded fallbacks | Partial coverage, not an absent SVG engine. Establish paired cases for patterns, filter graphs, references and resource-dependent foreignObject before choosing additions. |
| Accessibility and archival output | HTML interactive AcroForms, semantic tags and bounded vector MathML already exist; PdfOptions exposes the PDF owner's policy | Qualification and adapter gaps: validate requested PDF/A/PDF/UA artifacts independently; compare Formula semantics and original MathML associated-file mapping. Do not label the PDF core or forms unsupported. |
| Editable targets and scripted pages | Six editable adapters and optional managed/browser runtime paths have separate contracts | Additional OfficeIMO scope. These are not PeachPDF static-print parity criteria and retain their own loss and execution gates. |

The architecture remains coherent: shared document/layout/drawing/PDF owners and retained parser/script providers serve the conversion product. This assessment does not justify renderer replacement, Skia adoption or dependency retirement. The next scope is bounded static HTML-to-PDF capability and unfamiliar-page qualification, with browser print as an independent oracle.

## Reproduction and retained artifacts

Rebuild the comparison, editable, static-budget and H10-budget tools in Release from the recorded clean head. Run `html-corpus-evidence --corpus advanced-held-out --verify-acceptance --require-clean-source`, `html-mhtml-evidence --mhtml <frozen-archive> --require-clean-source`, the static budget with three iterations, and H10 case `nasa-solar-system-terrestrial-planets` with the recorded archive hash and unchanged case ceiling. The tool READMEs define complete commands and output contracts.

Current ignored artifacts remain under `Ignore/HtmlUnknownPageQualification/`: `h10-nasa-master-clean-40bd3f7bb`, `h10-h4-master-clean-40bd3f7bb`, `h10-static-budget-master-clean-40bd3f7bb`, and `h10-budget-planets-master-clean-40bd3f7bb`. Source archives and independent browser references remain separate from superseded generated outputs.
