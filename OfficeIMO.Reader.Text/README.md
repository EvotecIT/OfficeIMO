# OfficeIMO.Reader.Text (Preview)

`OfficeIMO.Reader.Text` is a modular path for improving non-Office text ingestion:
- CSV semantic chunking (table-aware)
- JSON/XML routing (currently via base Reader)
- future structured text adapters

Status:
- scaffolded and intentionally non-packable/non-publishable
